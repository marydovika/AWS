Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) play a critical role in environmental monitoring, yet
their deployment in remote and energy-constrained locations remains limited by rigid and
monolithic power architectures. Conventional systems are often designed for single energy
sources, leading to inefficiencies, frequent power interruptions, high maintenance costs, and
poor adaptability to dynamic environmental conditions. This research proposes the
development of a modular and adaptive power electronics system architecture tailored for
energy-constrained AWS deployments. The modular design introduces swappable converter topologies
that allow scalable integration (multiplexing) of multiple energy sources, including solar, DC input and 
batteries, while simplifying upgrades, repairs, and fault isolation.
Complementing this, an adaptive control strategy will be implemented to dynamically
optimize power flow in response to load variations, source intermittency, and environmental
disturbances, thereby enhancing system stability and efficiency. The study will involve
system design, simulation, and prototype development, followed by performance evaluation
under varying operating conditions. Expected outcomes include improved energy efficiency,
fault tolerance, and operational autonomy, ensuring more reliable and sustainable weather
data collection in resource-limited and off-grid regions. The findings of this research will
contribute to advancing resilient power system solutions that support agriculture, public
safety, infrastructure planning, and climate research.
